# 🎭 Micro-Expression Recognition using Deep Learning

Ever tried catching an emotion that lasts less than half a second?  
That’s exactly what this project is about.

This repository contains my **Bachelor Graduation Project**, where I explore **micro-expression recognition** using **deep learning** techniques on the **SAMM micro-expression dataset**.

Micro-expressions are extremely brief, involuntary facial expressions that reveal genuine emotions — making them one of the hardest problems in computer vision and affective computing.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to **detect and classify subtle facial micro-expressions from video sequences** by combining:

- **Spatial feature extraction** (what the face looks like)
- **Temporal modeling** (how facial movements evolve over time)

The pipeline is designed to capture tiny, short-duration facial changes that are often invisible to the human eye.

---

## 🧠 Methodology

The system follows a spatio-temporal deep learning pipeline:

1. **Preprocessing**
   - Face alignment and normalization
   - Selection of relevant frames around micro-expression intervals

2. **Feature Extraction**
   - Deep visual features extracted using CNN-based architectures

3. **Temporal Modeling**
   - Sequential modeling of facial dynamics using recurrent networks (e.g., BiLSTM)

4. **Classification**
   - Emotion category prediction based on learned representations

## 📊 Dataset

This project uses the **SAMM (Spontaneous Actions and Micro-Movements)** dataset:

- High frame-rate facial videos
- Precisely annotated onset, apex, and offset frames
- Widely used in academic micro-expression research

SAMM is known for being **challenging and realistic**, making it ideal for evaluating micro-expression models.

## 📈 Results & Evaluation

The model is evaluated using standard classification metrics such as:

- Accuracy
- Confusion matrix

The results show that **combining spatial and temporal representations** significantly improves the recognition of subtle facial movements.
